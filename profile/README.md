## 🙋‍♀️ Hey there!

This org mirrors popular (and unpopular) addons that currently only have a home on CurseForge, either intentionally or unintentionally. 
This allows users who aren't using the CurseForge Addon Manager a chance to have their addons automatically updated and, well.... managed!

#### [📝 Current Addon List](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/.github/blob/main/README.md)
#### [📢 Request New Addons Here](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/.github/issues/new?assignees=srhinos&labels=&template=addon-request.md&title=[REQ]%20New%20Addon%20Request)

We also host updated / customized versions of a few repos that make up the tech stack of our on going mirroring such as:

- 🧩[template](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/template): the template used to quickly generate new repos to mirror addons in just a few seconds!
- 🔄[actions-template-sync](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/actions-template-sync): Allows templatized repos to pull updates from the original template with a twist! Instead of opening a PR, it now pushes it straight to the master branch! No reviews required!
- ⛈️[cloudscraper](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/cloudscraper): Wraps Python's `requests` library with extra tools to ensure barring a full blown captcha, we can pull the addon's information with speed and efficency (and for free!)
