## 🙋‍♀️ Hey there!

This org mirrors popular (and unpopular) addons that currently only have a home on CurseForge, either intentionally or unintentionally. 
This allows users who aren't using the CurseForge Addon Manager a chance to have their addons automatically updated and, well.... managed!

If you have any requests for new Addons, feel free to open a ticket [here](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/.github) and we'll try and get it set up!
