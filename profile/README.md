## About

### 🙋‍♀️ Hey there!

This org mirrors popular (and unpopular) addons that currently only have a home on CurseForge, either intentionally or unintentionally. 
This allows users who aren't using the CurseForge Addon Manager a chance to have their addons automatically updated and, well.... managed!

While our name implies that we mirror from Curseforge, we do also happen to fork projects that are living on GitHub and apply our homegrown build pipeline to it so poorly configured repos can have a second life! 

If you're an addon author and have an All Rights Reserved addon that was mistakenly mirrored here, feel free to [file a ticket here](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/.github/issues/new?assignees=srhinos&labels=Removal Request&title=[REQ] Addon Removal Request) and the mirrored code will be removed ASAP!

## Misc

We also host updated / customized versions of a few repos that make up the tech stack of our on going mirroring such as:

- 🧩[template](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/template): the template used to quickly generate new repos to mirror addons in just a few seconds!
- 🔄[actions-template-sync](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/actions-template-sync): Allows templatized repos to pull updates from the original template with a twist! Instead of opening a PR, it now pushes it straight to the master branch! No reviews required!
- ⛈️[cloudscraper](https://github.com/curseforge-mirror/cloudscraper): Wraps Python's `requests` library with extra tools to ensure barring a full blown captcha, we can pull the addon's information with speed and efficency (and for free!)
